## Description
Team Profile Generator is a command line application that generates a static HTML page to display your developer team members. The user provides information about their team via command line questions using Inquirer. Once the team has been finalized, members are organized by position and may be contacted via email. The HTML is responsive for all viewing devices. This application demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming and test driven development with Jest.
